Return value: MatchDto
MatchDto
Name	Data Type	Description
metadata	MetadataDto	Match metadata.
info	InfoDto	Match info.
MetadataDto
Name	Data Type	Description
dataVersion	string	Match data version.
matchId	string	Match id.
participants	List[string]	A list of participant PUUIDs.
InfoDto
Name	Data Type	Description
endOfGameResult	string	Refer to indicate if the game ended in termination.
gameCreation	long	Unix timestamp for when the game is created on the game server (i.e., the loading screen).
gameDuration	long	Prior to patch 11.20, this field returns the game length in milliseconds calculated from gameEndTimestamp - gameStartTimestamp. Post patch 11.20, this field returns the max timePlayed of any participant in the game in seconds, which makes the behavior of this field consistent with that of match-v4. The best way to handling the change in this field is to treat the value as milliseconds if the gameEndTimestamp field isn't in the response and to treat the value as seconds if gameEndTimestamp is in the response.
gameEndTimestamp	long	Unix timestamp for when match ends on the game server. This timestamp can occasionally be significantly longer than when the match "ends". The most reliable way of determining the timestamp for the end of the match would be to add the max time played of any participant to the gameStartTimestamp. This field was added to match-v5 in patch 11.20 on Oct 5th, 2021.
gameId	long	
gameMode	string	Refer to the Game Constants documentation.
gameName	string	
gameStartTimestamp	long	Unix timestamp for when match starts on the game server.
gameType	string	
gameVersion	string	The first two parts can be used to determine the patch a game was played on.
mapId	int	Refer to the Game Constants documentation.
participants	List[ParticipantDto]	
platformId	string	Platform where the match was played.
queueId	int	Refer to the Game Constants documentation.
teams	List[TeamDto]	
tournamentCode	string	Tournament code used to generate the match. This field was added to match-v5 in patch 11.13 on June 23rd, 2021.

individualPosition	string	Both individualPosition and teamPosition are computed by the game server and are different versions of the most likely position played by a player. The individualPosition is the best guess for which position the player actually played in isolation of anything else. The teamPosition is the best guess for which position the player actually played if we add the constraint that each team must have one top player, one jungle, one middle, etc. Generally the recommendation is to use the teamPosition field over the individualPosition field.

totalHealsOnTeammates	int	Whenever positive health is applied (which translates to all heals in the game but not things like regeneration), totalHealsOnTeammates is incremented by the amount of health received. This is post modified, so if you heal someone missing 5 health for 100 you will get +5 totalHealsOnTeammates
